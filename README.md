# Protosun, a purist HTML5 game

The goal is to demonstrate the HTML5 platform while developing a really fun game without using ***any*** external framework or library.

It is not about unopinionated software, I just think that you have to learn walking before you can run. The purist style helps me teaching the platform, not libraries.

The [Protosun blog](http://tisztamo.github.io/protosun/) follows the development of the game explaining all details of the code and all glitches of JavaScript/CSS, giving you a deep understanding of HTML5 development.

We will also learn to encapsulate the game for mobile use, publish it to different stores and maybe some marketing stuff too.
