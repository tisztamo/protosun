Missiles are similar to spaceships; they have a propulsion engine. The main difference is that missiles detonate when they come into contact with other objects - or when they just get close to them. The detonation destroys the object hit, and it creates a shock wave, which pushes other objects away. To simulate all of this, we need to implement simple collision detection, and some way for `SpaceObject`s to act upon each other. A couple of CSS tricks will also come in handy to display the detonation.

### Simple collision detection

Naive collision detection is slow, but advanced techniques were developed during the long history of physics simulation. Most of them are based on the fact that the relative position (sorting order) of objects changes slowly. E.g.: We could split the scene into a number of cells so that objects rarely change cell, and we know that objects in different cells cannot collide.

Our situation is special because for the gravity simulation we already calculate the distance between the mass center of any two objects. This can be the base of the collision detection: Two objects cannot collide without being close enough.

On the other hand, two objects can act upon each other from a distance like missiles do: they detonate when close enough to the target. So I have decided to implement an abstraction of the collision detection, allowing every object to act on other objects based on their distance. For now, only missiles will act on other objects by detonating when close enough.

#### spaceobject.js:
```javascript
SpaceObject.prototype.actOn = function (another, distance) {};
```

#### simulation.js:
```diff
Simulation.prototype.oneStep = function () {
...
  while (outerIdx < length) {
    outerObject = spaceObjects[outerIdx];
    for (var j = outerIdx + 1; j < length; j++) {
      innerObject = spaceObjects[j];
      distance = SpaceObject.actGravityForce(outerObject, innerObject);
+      outerObject.actOn(innerObject, distance);
+      innerObject.actOn(outerObject, distance);
    }
    outerObject.oneStep();
    outerIdx++;
  }
```
#### missile.js:

```javascript
Missile.prototype.actOn = function (another, distance) {
  if (distance < 20 && !this.detonated) {
    this.detonate(another);
  }
};
```

### Missile Launching

Missiles fly using a propulsion engine, so launching one means just creating it in front of the spaceship with the same heading and velocity. The engine will speed it up so that it can divert from the spaceship. Missiles work exactly that way, though not many game simulates this precisely.


```javascript
SpaceShip.prototype.launchMissile = function () {
  var direction = Vector.createFromPolar(this.heading, 1);
  var pos = this.pos.clone().add(direction.clone().multiply(30));
  var v = this.v.clone();
  var missile = new Missile(pos, v, this.heading);
  this.simulation.addSpaceObject(missile);
};
```

### Missile lifecycle

Missiles are dynamically created and added to the simulation, but we need to limit their total number heavily in the simulation, as we have O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithms. As missiles are faster than any other object, they will escape from the scene quickly, so we can just remove them after a while.

Another problem is that missiles need to speed up quickly but if they continue accelerating, they will be too fast. I have solved this problem by limiting the fuel the missile has.

```javascript
function Missile(pos, v, heading, lifeSteps, fuel) {
  SpaceObject.call(this, pos, v, 0.001, heading);
  this.lifeSteps = lifeSteps || 480;
  this.fuel = fuel || 55;
  this.detonated = false;
  this.engineRunning = true;
}

Missile.prototype.mainEnginePower = 0.0001;

Missile.prototype.oneStep = function () {
  SpaceObject.prototype.oneStep.call(this);
  --this.lifeSteps;
  if (this.lifeSteps <= 0 && !this.detonated) {
    this.simulation.removeSpaceObject(this);
  }
  if (this.engineRunning) {
    this.stepForce.add(Vector.createFromPolar(this.heading, this.mainEnginePower));
    if (--this.fuel <= 0) {
      this.engineRunning = false;
    }
  }
};
```

### Detonation

A detonation could be simulated with a lot of small objects flying out with different speed. We may do this later, but for now a simpler approach is enough: we will render the detonation as an animation and model it with a special object in the simulation.

The interesting part is the display. The detonation contains an image, which will grow:

```html
  <div class="template spaceobject detonation" id="detonation">
    <img src="img/detonation.png">
  </div>
```

Its width and height are set to 0 initially and transitioned to 600px when the detonation is "detonated".

```css
.detonation {
  z-index: 20000;
  opacity: 1;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
}

.detonated.detonation {
  opacity: 0;
  width: 600px;
  height: 600px;
  transition: all 1.5s;
  -webkit-transition: all 1.5s;
}
```

The trick is that the image fills the detonation `div` fully, but it has negative (-50%) `margin`, so it is continuously centered at the same point. No need to adjust its position during the transition. 
According to the CSS spec, the base of the % value is the width of the enclosing element, and negative values are allowed.
 
```css
.detonation img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  margin-left: -50%;
  margin-top: -50%;
}
```

There is a problem: transitions will not start when the element is added to the DOM, because it is not clear, what should be the starting value of the transition. The `.detonated` class solves this problem; we add it to the element later, triggering the transition.

Another gotcha is that - to optimize performance - the browser collects DOM changes and delays style recalculation as long as possible. So if we add the class directly after creating the element, but before it was displayed, the browser will not see this as a change. Instead of an animated transition, the detonation will just show up fully sized.

We have to force recalculating styles before adding the `detonated` class. Unfortunately, no direct API call is available for that, we have to hack: reading the `clientHeight` property triggers style recalculation.

> This is a special case, style recalculation is costly, you want to avoid it most of the time. If you want to understand the behavior of the browser fully, you can play with the timeline in the developer tools.

```javascript
DOMRenderer.prototype.updateDetonationView = function (view) {
  if (!view.classList.contains("detonated")) {
    // Reading clientHeight forces style recalculation, which is needed
    // to start the transition
    var forceStyleRecalc = view.clientHeight != 0.001;
    view.classList.add("detonated");
  }
};
```

### Shock Wave

The freshly added possibility to act on other `SpaceObject`s from a distance would allow easy implementing of the shock wave. But a simpler approach is to set the mass of the detonation to a negative value, causing the gravitational force to turn over and push other objects away. The detonation effect is so fast that this method gives a lifelike result.

The gravitation force has to be neutralized on the detonation as we do not want it to fly away from near objects. I had simply zeroed `stepForce` in `Detonation.oneStep`


```javascript
function Detonation(pos, v) {
  SpaceObject.call(this, pos, v, -0.15);
  this.permeable = true;
  this.lifeSteps = 100;
}

Detonation.prototype = new SpaceObject();
Detonation.prototype.constructor = Detonation;

Detonation.prototype.oneStep = function () {
  this.stepForce = Vector.zero.clone();
  SpaceObject.prototype.oneStep.call(this);
  if (--this.lifeSteps <= 0) {
    this.simulation.removeSpaceObject(this);
  }
};
```

### Conclusion

Negative CSS margins are great to display an element relative to an origin. But sometimes it won't give you enough flexibility. If you check the full source code deeper, you will see that `SpaceObject`s are positioned to their origin using JavaScript in `DOMRenderer`.

I have showed the negative margin method here because I think that you should avoid JavaScript positioning whenever possible. It is possible to do it with CSS most of the time. If you think it is not possible, recall my grandfather: Try harder!
