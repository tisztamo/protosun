Today we will create a solar system simulator with multiple stars, planets, and moons! 

This post is mostly about game physics and optimizations, but we will also learn a trick using constructors. This is the first time when you can have real fun with the game: just [download the source](https://github.com/tisztamo/protosun/archive/20150618_gravity.zip) and create a new solar system!


### Collecting forces, accelerating objects

> Newton's second law: The vector sum of the external forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector a of the object: F = ma. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion)) 

At the time, we only want to implement gravity but we will later simulate other forces like collisions, dark energy or maybe solar winds. So to calculate the acceleration of SpaceObjects, in every round we have to collect all the acting forces. We also need to know the mass of the object:

```javascript
function SpaceObject(pos, v, mass) {
...
  this.mass = mass || 1;
  this.reciprocalMass = 1 / this.mass;
  this.stepForce = new Vector(0, 0);
...
}
```

When the forces are collected, we can calculate the acceleration as the sum of forces divided by the mass, which we have to add to the speed vector:

```javascript
SpaceObject.prototype.oneStep = function () {
  this.v.add(this.stepForce.multiply(this.reciprocalMass));
  this.pos.add(this.v);
  this.stepForce = new Vector(0, 0);
};
```

### Gravity force

So we only have to calculate the gravity force, and we can go!

![Gravity force equation](../../../assets/article_images/2015/gravity.png)

Here we see an interesting optimization problem. It would be nice to create a method in SpaceObject which gets an another SpaceObject and 'acts' on it, calculating every force originating from this SpaceObject and acting on the other. We would call this method on every SpaceObject, giving it every other SpaceObject so every force would be calculated. This design will allow modifying behavior, e.g.: implementing anti-gravity shields would be easy.

But the calculation of gravity force is not trivial, and we have to calculate between any two objects, so the calculation is 0(n<sup>2</sup>). I prefer to optimize based on the fact that gravity force is symmetric: If we calculate the G force between two objects, we can use it on both objects with changed sign. This optimization prohibits creating the nice interface, but it will run faster - although it remains 0(n<sup>2</sup>).

So I have created a static method which gets two objects and acts on both: 

```javascript
SpaceObject.actGravityForce = function (spaceObject1, spaceObject2) {
  var distance = spaceObject1.pos.distanceFrom(spaceObject2.pos);
  var forceMagnitude = spaceObject1.mass * spaceObject2.mass * SpaceObject.G / Math.pow(distance, 2);
  var forceDirection = spaceObject1.pos.substractToNew(spaceObject2.pos).toUnitVector();
  var force = forceDirection.multiply(forceMagnitude);
  spaceObject2.stepForce.add(force);
  spaceObject1.stepForce.add(force.multiply(-1));
};
```

> This code uses some newly implemented vector operations, [you can check them here](https://github.com/tisztamo/protosun/commit/d64533c7dbb21d1954106337a12c66b12f3ba93f#commitcomment-11719004) if you are interested. Most of them work in-place because creating new objects is considered slow.

We calculate the magnitude (a scalar), and the direction (a unit vector) separately, then combine them to the calculated gravity force (vector). G is the gravitational constant, which I had to set using trial and error so that the simulation looks nice. (This is a known physical constant, but we aren't in SI)

Thanks to this optimization, we can calculate the gravity force only once for every SpaceObject pair. The inner cycle starts from the actual value of the outer cycle counter:

```javascript
Simulation.prototype.oneStep = function () {
  var length = this.spaceObjects.length;
  var spaceObjects = this.spaceObjects;
  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (var j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
      SpaceObject.actGravityForce(spaceObjects[i], spaceObjects[j]);
    }
    spaceObjects[i].oneStep();
  }
  this.renderer.oneStepTaken();
};
```

> Storing `this.spaceObjects` in a local variable is a common speed optimization trick. This time I am sure it is premature optimization without real effect because `actGravityForce()` does a lot of computation. Anyway, it doesn't hurt code readability.

### Stars, Planets, Moons

We need different SpaceObjects. For now the difference is only the rendering, but later their behavior will also be different. So I have created `SpaceObject` 'subclasses':

#### star.js:
```javascript
function Star(pos, v, mass) {
  SpaceObject.call(this, pos, v, mass);
}

Star.prototype = new SpaceObject();
Star.prototype.constructor = Star;
```

This does nothing at the time, but it has an own constructor function which allows us to select the template used for rendering. In `DOMRenderer.prototype.spaceObjectAdded` we specify the name of the template as the lowercase name of the constructor function that was used to create this `SpaceObject`:

```javascript
DOMRenderer.prototype.spaceObjectAdded = function (spaceObject) {
  this.createView(spaceObject.constructor.name.toLowerCase(), spaceObject);
...
```

So we have templates for every `SpaceObject` type, like this:

```html
<div class="template spaceobject star" id="star">
  <img src="img/star.svg" width="40" height="40">
</div>
```

And we add different `SpaceObjects` to our simulation:

### main.js:
```javascript
simulation.setUpModel = function () {
  this.addSpaceObject(new Star(new Vector(400, 200), new Vector(0, 0), 5));
  this.addSpaceObject(new Planet(new Vector(200, 200), new Vector(0, 1.5)), 1);
  this.addSpaceObject(new Moon(new Vector(170, 200), new Vector(0, 3.5), 0.1));
  this.addSpaceObject(new Planet(new Vector(600, 200), new Vector(0, -1.5), 1));
  this.addSpaceObject(new Moon(new Vector(630, 200), new Vector(0, -3.5), 0.1));
  this.addSpaceObject(new Moon(new Vector(200, -1200), new Vector(0, 1), 0.1));
};
```

This is the model I have created. It contains a star, two planets with moons and an asteroid, which comes a bit later disordering the stable system.

I suggest you to play with the simulator and to create your own solar system!

> You will notice that because we didn't yet implemented collision detection, strange things happens when two objects collide. It is an interesting challenge to create stable systems. 

### Conclusion

After a lot of preparation in the first four posts, we have a flexible framework and the knowledge to implement insanely exciting things.

And we will do it!
