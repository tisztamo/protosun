Everybody knows, that multiple inheritance is problematic. Fortunately, the JavaScript prototype chain doesn't allow multiple inheritance. The problem is that relations of real-world objects can hardly be mapped to simple hierarchies. We already face this problem in our simple simulation.

### The problem

Both `Missile` and `SpaceShip` are driven by a propulsion engine. The classic OOP way of code reuse is to introduce an intermediate base class, which will hold the common code:

But spaceships can also launch missiles. What if we also want to add this behavior to planets, while reusing the missile launching code? Should we introduce a new intermediate base class again?

![](../../../assets/article_images/2015/missilelauncher.svg)

Definitely not.

It is not just impossible with JavaScript prototypes; it also contains the problematic "diamond" pattern. But the main problem is that this hierarchy terribly diverges from our view of the world. It suggests that the main quality of a `Planet` is that it ***is*** a `MissileLauncher`. But it is intuitively a `SpaceObject` that can launch missiles.

`MissileLauncher` and `EnginePowered` are capabilities, more or less independent from `SpaceObject`. A better model is this:

### Mixins

This model eliminates the diamond pattern by not having intermediate classes. It also maps better to our view of the world: `MissileLauncher` and `EnginePowered` are capabilities that we can add to ("mix into") other classes. 

Technically, they are collections of methods and properties that implement a well-defined functionality, but they cannot stay alone. We will never instantiate them directly, but copy them into other classes. You can also think of them as an interface with default implementation.

> The term mixin is widely used but loosely defined in the OOP world. Some languages include constructs to support it directly, others - like JavaScript - let you implement them your way.

As you may have suspected, there are a couple of ways to implement mixins in JavaScript. [Some authors](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/10/07/javascript-mixins-beyond-simple-object-extension/) mix functionality from highly unrelated 3rd party objects into their own ones, so they want to have a strong separation between the source and the target. (They just delegate the functionality)

On the other side, we want to use mixins to eliminate intermediate base classes, so we will mix related code chunks together. Besides adding newly separated functionality, we want to modify the behavior of the base class when mixing the new capability into it - e.g. the propulsion engine generates a force in every step. So our mixins will be able to access the extended object.

Another consideration is that mixing the functionality of objects on the fly will quickly lead to chaos. If you find an object during debugging, but its capabilities and the location of its source code is not clear, then you are in trouble. To avoid this, I want every object in the code to have exactly one class, the possible prototype chains are defined in the classes and never modified after object creation.

So let's see the most basic mixin implementation, which can do that! This is the way we mix the functionality from `EnginePowered` into `SpaceShip`:

#### SpaceShip.js:

```javascript
function SpaceShip(pos, v, mass, heading) {
  SpaceObject.call(this, pos, v, mass, heading);
  EnginePowered.call(this);
}

SpaceShip.prototype = new SpaceObject();
SpaceShip.prototype.constructor = SpaceShip;

EnginePowered.mixInto(SpaceShip);
```

`EnginePowered`, a mixin, is like a normal class, but it has the `mixInto` static method. It gets this method from `Mixin`, the base mixin.

#### EnginePowered.js:

```javascript
function EnginePowered(enginePower, fuel, engineRunning) {
  this.fuel = fuel || Infinity;
  this.enginePower = enginePower || 0.001;
  this.engineRunning = engineRunning || false;
}

Mixin.mixInto(EnginePowered); 

EnginePowered.prototype.oneStep = function () {
  if (this.engineRunning) {
    this.stepForce.add(Vector.createFromPolar(this.heading, this.enginePower));
    if (--this.fuel <= 0) {
      this.engineRunning = false;
    }
  }
  //... calling the overridden method will be discussed below
};

EnginePowered.prototype.startEngine = function () {
  this.engineRunning = true;
};

EnginePowered.prototype.stopEngine = function () {
  this.engineRunning = false;
};
```

> **deep note:** Mixins aren't subclasses of `Mixin`, the `mixInto` method is mixed into them. This is not just very cool; it also eliminates the need to create instances of mixins, as it adds the `mixInto` method to the constructor function, not to the prototype.

To prevent mixing functionality on the fly, the `mixInto` method works on classes, not on objects. It just copies everything from the mixin class to the target class:


### Mixin.js:

```javascript
function Mixin() {}

Mixin.mixInto = function (target) {
  if (this === Mixin) {
    target.mixInto = this.mixInto;
    return;
  }
    
  for (var propertyName in this.prototype) {
    target.prototype[propertyName] = this.prototype[propertyName];
  }
};
```

### Overriding methods from mixins

The simple approach discussed above allows extending classes with new capabilities in a controlled way. This is what is usually called a mixin.

But we want more: We want to modify the behavior of the original class when the mixin is mixed into it. It can be done by overriding methods in the class from the mixin.

The problem is that we have to maintain the prototype chain so that we will really modify the behavior and not just replace it. To do this, we will store the original method found in the prototype before overriding it. We will create the `mixinOverride` object in the prototype, and every mixin that is mixed into the class creates a new object inside it with its own name, holding references to overridden methods.

![](../../../assets/article_images/2015/mixinoverride.png)

Then the new method (defined in the mixin) can call the old one by accessing it from the current object (see the last line):

```javascript
EnginePowered.prototype.oneStep = function () {
  if (this.engineRunning) {
    this.stepForce.add(Vector.createFromPolar(this.heading, this.enginePower));
    if (--this.fuel <= 0) {
      this.engineRunning = false;
    }
  }
  this.mixinOverride.EnginePowered.oneStep.call(this);
};
```

`this.mixinOverride.EnginePowered.oneStep` contains a reference to the `oneStep` method of the class, as it was in the prototype *before* mixing the new functionality in. Just like with inheritance, we can call the overridden method to extend the functionality.

The full code of `mixInto` follows:

```javascript
Mixin.mixInto = function (target) {
  if (this === Mixin) {
    target.mixInto = this.mixInto;
    return;
  }

  target.prototype.mixinOverride = target.prototype.mixinOverride || {};

  var overridenMethods = {};
  for (var propertyName in this.prototype) {
    if (typeof target.prototype[propertyName] === "function") {
      overridenMethods[propertyName] = target.prototype[propertyName];
    }
    target.prototype[propertyName] = this.prototype[propertyName];
  }
  target.prototype.mixinOverride[this.name] = overridenMethods;
};
```

### Conclusion

Mixins are an excellent tool of code reuse. They also help solving the problems of multiple inheritance, and they allow intuitive modeling of the domain we work with. But without control - just like other abstraction constructs, especially whose are lacking language support - they may do more harm than good.

Modifying the behavior of existing objects is usually dangerous, and should be used sparingly. I think that it is a good thing if every object has exactly one dynamic type during its full lifecycle - just like in statically typed languages.

I like the mixin implementation discussed here because it disallows mixing functionality into existing objects, thus it preserves this important rule.
